# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is your fundamental right, and Bliss AI is designed with this principle at its core. Here's how your data is handled:

<br>

## 1.0 Information We Collect

### 1.1 Data Storage
All your personal data is saved exclusively locally on YOUR device. Not even I, the developer, can access it.

### 1.2 NO Tracking or Ads
Bliss AI does NOT track you or show you ads. Your data isn't sold either.

<br>

## 2.0 How We Use Your Information

### 2.1 Data Transmission
Your data is sent ONLY to the AI model (Gemini 1.5 Pro) when required to generate personalized responses. This transmission is encrypted and secure.

### 2.2 AI Model Training
Your interactions and data will NOT be used to train the AI model (as Bliss AI uses the premium paid Gemini API).

### 2.3 Bliss AI Tutor Memory
The Bliss AI tutor's self-learnt memory is saved ONLY locally on your device. You can access and modify it in the app settings at any time.

<br>

## 3.0 Permissions and Third-Party Services

### 3.1 ONLY One Permission Requested
Bliss AI requests an optional Android Notifications permission to remind you of your To-Do tasks with a notification. It can be revoked at any time.

### 3.2 Third-Party Services
Bliss AI uses Google’s Gemini API (specifically, the paid version that doesn’t store your interactions for model improvement). Their use of data is governed by Google’s privacy policy.

<br>

## 4.0 Your Rights and Choices

### 4.1 Data Deletion
You can delete all your data by uninstalling the app as it is only saved locally.

### 4.2 Changes to Privacy Policy
This privacy policy could be updated in the future.

<br>

## 5.0 Contact Information
For any privacy-related questions (or otherwise), please contact me (the developer) at [jesaitarun@gmail.com](mailto:jesaitarun@gmail.com).

I'm committed to protecting your data and maintaining your trust.
